                    Here is your pantry. This is where you will update what you currently have to work with. A recipe will be reccommended
                    based on the first thing you put in your pantry. Because of this, it is very important to update this frequently.

            This will look similar to the Home page except will include arrows. 
            When you highlight the arrows a text box will pop up that will explain the different hyperlinks and arrows.
